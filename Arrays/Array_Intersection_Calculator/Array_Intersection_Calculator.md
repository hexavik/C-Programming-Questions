# Array Intersection Calculator

**Problem Statement:**

Given two integer arrays, your task is to design a program that efficiently determines the intersection of the arrays. The intersection of two arrays is defined as the set of elements that are common to both arrays.

**Requirements:**

Write a function or program that takes two integer arrays as input and returns a new array containing only the elements that are present in both input arrays.

**Input:**

The input consists of two integer as `array1` and `array2`.

```bash
array1 = [1, 2, 4, 5, 2]
array2 = [2, 3, 5, 7]
```

**Output:**

the program should output a new array representing the intersection of `array1` and `array 2`.

```bash
result = [2, 5]
```

**Constraints:**

- The input arrays can have duplicate elements.
- The output array should not contain duplicate elements.
- The order of elements in the output array does not matter.
