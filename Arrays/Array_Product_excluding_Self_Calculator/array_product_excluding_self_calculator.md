# Array Product Calculator Excluding Self

**Problem Statement:**

Given an integer array, your objective is to design a program that calculates the product of all elements in the array except the element at the current index.

**Requirements:**

Write a function or program that takes an integer array as input and returns a new array containing the product of all elements except the element at the corresponding index.

**Input:**

The input consists of a single integer array, denoted as `arr`.

```bash
arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

**Output:**

The program should output a new array respresenting the product of all elements except the element at the corresponding index.

```bash
result = [24, 12, 8, 6]
```

**Constraints:**

- The input array will not contain zero.
- The output array should be calculated without using division.
- you can assume that the input array has at least two elements.
