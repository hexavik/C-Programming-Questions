# Divisible Sum Pairs Checker

**Problem Statement:**

Given an integer array and a positive integer `k`, your goal is to design a program that determines if the array can be divided into pairs such that the sum of each pair's numbers is divisible by `k`.

**Requirements:**

Write a function or program that takes an integer array and a positive integer `k` as input and determines if the array can be segmented into pairs with a sum divisible by `k`.

**Input:**

the input consists of an integer array, dentoed as `arr`, and a positive integer `k`.

```bash
arr = [9, 7, 5, -3]
k = 6
```

**Output:**

The program should output a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether the array can be divided into pairs such that the sum of each pair's numbers is divisible by `k`.

```bash
result = True
```

**Constraints:**

- The input array can have duplicate elements.
- The value of `k` will be greater than 0.
- You can assume that the input array has an even numbers of elements.
