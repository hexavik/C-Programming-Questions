# Duplicate Number Detector

**Problem Statement:**

Given an integer array, your objective is to design a program that identifies if there are any duplicate numbers in the array.

**Requirements:**

Write a function or program that takes an integer array as input and determines if there exists any integer that appears more frequently than it should, indicatiing the presence of a duplicate.

**Input:**

The input consists of a single integer array, denoted as `arr`.

```bash
arr = [3, 1, 4, 2, 3]
```

**Output:**

The program shoould output a boolean value (`True` or `False`) indicating whether there are duplicate numbers in the array.

```bash
Result = True
```

**Constraints:**

- The input array can have duplicate elements.
- The output should be `True` if any duplicate is found and `False` otherwise.
- You can assume that the input array has at least two element.
