# duplicate Remover without Libraries

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array, your task is to design a program that removes duplicates from the array without using any external libraries.

## Requirements

Write a function or program that takes an integer array as input and modifies it to remove any repetitive occurrences of numbers, ensuring that each number appears only once.

## Input

The input consists of a single integer array, denoted as `arr`.

```bash
arr = [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 4]
```

## Output

The program should modify the input array to represent the result of removing duplicates.

```bash
Result = [1, 2, 3, 4]
```

## Constraints

- The input array can have duplicate elements.
- The order of elements in the output array should be the same as their first occurrence in the input array.
- You can assume that the input array has at least one element.
