# Equilibrium Index Finder

**Problem Statement:**

Given an integer array, your goal is to design a program that finds the equilibrium index of the array, where the sum of elements on the left is equal to the sum on the right.

**Requirements:**

Write a function or program that takes an integer array as input and determines the equilibrium index, if any.

**Input:**

The input consists of a single integer array, denoted as `arr`.

```bash
arr = [-7, 1, 5, 2, -4, 3, 0]
```

**Output:**

The program should output an integer representing the equilibrium index. If there is no equilibrium index, the program should output an appropriate indication (e.g. -1).

```bash
Result = 3
```

**Constraints:**

- The input array can have both positive and negative integers.
- If there are multiple equilibrium indices, return any one of them.
- If no equilibirum index exists, return -1.
