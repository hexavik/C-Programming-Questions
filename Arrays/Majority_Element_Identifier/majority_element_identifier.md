# Majority Element Identifier

## Problem Statement

Given an integer array, your objective is to design a program that identifies the majority element, which appears more than `n/2` times, where `n` is the length of the array.

## Requirements

Write a function or program that takes an integer array as input and determines the majority element.

## Input

The input consists of a single integer array, denoted as `arr`.

```bash
arr = [3, 3, 4, 2, 4, 4, 2, 4, 4]
```

## Output

The program should output an integer representing the majority element.

```bash
result = 4
```

## Constraints

- The majority element is guaranteed to exist in the input array.
- You can assume that the input array has at least one element.
