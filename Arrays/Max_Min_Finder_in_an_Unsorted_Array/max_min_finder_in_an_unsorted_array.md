# Max-Min Finder in an Unsorted Array

## Problem Statement

Given an unsorted integer array, your goal is to design a program that finds the largest and smallest numbers in the array.

## Requirements

Write a function or program that takes an unsorted integer array as input and identifies the maximum and minimum values.

## Input

The input consists of a single unsorted integer array, denoted as `arr`.

```bash
arr = [34, 15, 88, 2]
```

## Output

The program should output the maximum and minimum values found in the input array.

```bash
Max: 88, Min: 2
```

## Constraints

- The input array can have duplicate elements.
- You can assume that the input array has at least one element.
