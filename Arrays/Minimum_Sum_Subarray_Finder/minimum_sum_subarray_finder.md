# Minimum Sum Subarray Finder

**Problem Statement:**

Given an integer array, your task is to design a program that finds the subarray with the smallest sum.

**Requirements:**

Write a function or program that takes an integer array as input and identifies the subarray with the smallest sum.

**Input:**

The input consists of a single integer array, denoted as `arr`.

```bash
arr = [3, 1, -4, 2, 0]
```

**Output:**

The program should output an integer representing the minimum sum found in any subarray of the input array.

```bash
result = -4
```

**Constraints:**

- The input array can have both positive and negative integers.
- If there are mutliple subarrays with the same minimum sum, return any one of them.
- You can assume that the inout array has at least one element.
