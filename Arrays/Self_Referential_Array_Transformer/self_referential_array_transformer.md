# Self-Referential Array Transformer

**Problem Statement:**

Rearrange a given array such that for each index `i`, the value at `arr[i]` is updated to the value at the index specified by the original `arr[i]`.

**Requirements:**

Write a program or function to transform the array as described, without using additional arrays to store intermediate results.

**Input:**

An integer array `arr` of size `n`, where `n≥1`. Each element `arr[i]` satisfies `0≤arr[i]<n`.

```bash
arr = [2, 0, 1, 3]
```

**Output:**

The transformed array `arr`, where `arr[i]` becomes `arr[arr[i]]` for all valid indices `i`.

```bash
result = [0, 1, 2, 3];
```

**Constraints:**

- The input array arrarr must contain integers within the range `[0,n−1]`.
- The transformation must be performed in-place, i.e., without using an auxiliary array for storing intermediate values.

**Notes:**

- **Transformation Logic:**
  - For each index ii, calculate the new value as `arr[arr[i]]` using the original array values.
  - Use encoding techniques (e.g., storing multiple values in a single element) to ensure the transformation can occur in-place without losing the original data.
- Ensure that the program does not modify the array until all transformations are accounted for to avoid conflicts.
