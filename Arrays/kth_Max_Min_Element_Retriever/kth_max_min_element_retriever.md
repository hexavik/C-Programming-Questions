# kth Max-Min Element Retriever

**Problem Statement:**

Given an integer array and a positive integer `k`, your objective is to design a program that finds the kth maximum and kth minimum elements of the array.

**Requirements:**

Write a function or program that takes an integer array and a positive integer `k` as input and retrieves the kth largest and kth smallest elements.

**Input:**

The input consists of an integer array, denoted as `arr`, and a positive integer `k`.

```bash
arr = [7, 10, 4, 3, 20, 15]
k = 3
```

**Output:**

The program should output two integers representing the kth largest and kth smallest elements, respectively.

```bash
Result_max = 7
Result_min = 10
```

**Constraints:**

- The input array can have duplicate elements.
- The value of `k` will be greater than 0 and less than or equal to the length of the array.
- You can assume that the input array has at least one element.
